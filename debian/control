Description: A Media player for Gtk+.
 Unlike Rhythmbox, Banshee or itunes, Xnoise uses a tracklist centric design. 
 The tracklist is a list of video or music tracks that are played one by one 
 without being removed. This gives you the possibility to enqueue any track 
 in any order, regardless if they are on the same album or not. The tracks can 
 be reordered at any time via drag and drop.
 .
 The media browser contains all available media in a hierarchical tree structure 
 of the available metadata. It is easy to find a single track, artist or album by 
 going through this tree or by just entering a search term. From the media browser, 
 music or videos can be dragged into the tracklist to every position.
 Xnoise can play every kind of audio/video data that gstreamer can handle.
 There is are plugins available.
